        "\n",
        "Welcome to this step-by-step guide on fine-tuning the [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b) using [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Gemma**](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.\n",
        "\n",
        "[**Unsloth**](https://unsloth.ai/) is a Python framework developed for finetuning large language models like Gemma 2.4x faster, using 58% less VRAM, and with no degradation in accuracy.\n",

        "In this notebook, you will learn how to finetune Gemma 2 models using **Unsloth** in a Google Colab environment. You'll install the necessary packages, finetune the model, and run a sample inference.\n",

The structure of an atom can be described as a nucleus at the center surrounded by a cloud of electrons.\\n\\nThe nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles and neutrons are neutral particles with no charge. Both of these particles are located in the nucleus of the atom, which is at the center of the atom and contains most of the atom's mass.\\n\\nSurrounding the nucleus of the atom is a cloud of electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that are in constant motion around the nucleus. The electron cloud is divided into shells or orbitals, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The number of electrons in the outermost shell, called the valence shell, determines the chemical properties of the atom. \\n\\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the electron cloud, so the positive and negative charges balance out and the atom has no overall charge.

Reduce energy consumption: By conserving energy, we reduce the amount of pollution emitted from power plants. Some ways to achieve this include: using energy-efficient appliances and lighting, insulating homes, and shutting off lights and electronics when not in use.\\n\\n2. Use public transportation or carpool: Cars and trucks are major sources of pollution. By using public transportation, carpooling or biking, you can reduce the number of cars on the road, which in turn reduces emissions.\\n\\n3. Be responsible with waste: When waste is burned or decomposed, they can release harmful gases into the air. Dispose of hazardous waste correctly and recycle materials like plastics, paper, and glass when possible.\\n\\n4. Support clean energy sources: Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power generate little or no pollution. Support clean energy companies and projects, and consider installing renewable energy systems in your home.\\n\\n5. Drive efficiently: If you need to drive, make sure your vehicle is well maintained and drive efficiently by avoiding rapid acceleration and braking, and reducing idling.\\n\\n6.
